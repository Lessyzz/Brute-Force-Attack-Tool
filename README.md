# Things to do

- Replace "line 7" with your own "chromedriver.exe" path.

- Replace "line 48" with website username "input name". And replace "admin" with username.

- Replace "line 49" with website password "input name".

- Replace "line 50" with website submit button "XPATH" or "input name".

- Finally, you should edit "line 52" as the login failed or login successful page.

You can use this brute force attacking tool with "Tor Browser". If you edit here like that you can brute force with Tor proxy.
